        "Therapeutic Drug MonitoringWhat is it and Why is it Done?Therapeutic Drug Monitoring(TDM) refers to the  measurement of drug  concentrations in the blood  or plasma of a patient to  keep it within a target range.TDM provides information  about the adequacy of  dosing of the drug regimen  and the likelihood of toxicity  associated with the drug.TDMDosingToxicityMonitoringThings that affect tdm is dosing, compliance/monitoring (person is taking it or not), toxicity (taking too much) || SLIDE #: 4",

        "Why do Therapeutic Drug Monitoring  (TDM)?Narrow Therapeutic RangeDrugs have therapeutic rangesTaking a drug orally is in this diagram As you take it, concentration goes up peaks, and as eliminated it goes downReaches blue in is the minimum therapeutic effectOnce it goes below level of effect there is no pain relief Toxic concentration is exceeding rightMore dangerous drugs have smaller therapeutic ranges – harder to keep drug level effective yet not toxicMost durgs tho, you don’t take once, you take repeatablyThe challenge is to keep the peak and trough in the therapeutic range in each successive dosingDpeening on range, it could be hrader or easier to keep the drug in the safe zone || SLIDE #: 6",
        "Therapeutic Range with  Repeated DosingBlue line is continuous infusion (IV) / red Is oralHow constant influion would get you up in the range and keeps you in the correct range so you don’t have overdosing and eventually get to steady state concentrationAs long as noghting perturbes steady state that dose will keep you in the therapeutic range || SLIDE #: 7",

        "Epilepsy - OverviewEpilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological  disorder) in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes  disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour,  sensations and sometimes loss of consciousness.Seizure symptoms can vary widely.From a simply blank stare for a few seconds to repeated twitching of arms or legs.About 1 in 26 people in the United States will develop a  seizure disorder.Nearly 10% of individuals may have a single unprovoked seizure.However, a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked  seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.Even mild seizures may require treatment because they can  be dangerous during activities such as driving or swimming.Treatment with medications or surgery is ~80% effectiveChildren with epilepsy may also outgrow their condition withage. || SLIDE #: 50",
        "SymptomsEpilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in brain cellscan affect any process your brain coordinates.Seizure signs and symptoms may include:Temporary confusionA staring spellUncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legsLoss of consciousness or awarenessPsychic symptomsGenerally classify seizures as either focal or  generalized, based on how the abnormal brain  activity begins. || SLIDE #: 51",
        "Focal SeizuresWhen seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in  just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial)  seizures.Focal seizures without loss of consciousness (simplepartial seizures).These seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or  change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in  involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous  sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.Focal dyscognitive seizures (complex partial seizures).These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During  a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally  to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing,  chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.Symptoms may be confused with other neurological  disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. || SLIDE #: 52",
        "Generalized SeizuresoSeizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called  generalized seizures.1.\tAbsence seizures. (previously known as petit mal seizures)often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movementsooooosuch as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief lossof awareness.Tonic seizures.Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles and may cause you to fall to the ground.Atonic seizures.Also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenlycollapse or fall down.Clonic seizures.Associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements.Myoclonic seizures.Usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs.Tonic-clonic seizures. (previously known as grand mal seizures,)The most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness,  body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. || SLIDE #: 53",

        "CausesEpilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half of those  with the condition.Genetic influence.It's estimated that up to 500 genes could be tied to the condition. Certain  genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that  trigger seizures.Head trauma.Car accident or other traumatic injuryBrain conditions.Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumours or  strokes,Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35.Infectious diseases.Meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitisPrenatal injury.Infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies.Developmental disorders.Can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism  and neurofibromatosis. || SLIDE #: 55",
