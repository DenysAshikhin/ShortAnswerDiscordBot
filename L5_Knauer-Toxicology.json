        "SLIDE #: 3 || Toxicology\nPurpose of Toxicology Testing:\nTo detect, identify, and possibly measure, in various biological fluids, drugs and poisons which may or may not be suspected to be present.\nSubstance could be illicit or prescribed \n",
        "SLIDE #: 4 || Patients\nEmergency\nBabies and new mothers\nPsychiatric\nPain Clinic\nSexual Assault Centre\nInpatients (ICU)\nwho do we look at for testing?\n- most come from emergency departments where patients come in and you look for drug abuse\n- new mothers and babies sometiems tested for illicit drug use for CAS cases\n- psychiatric for compliance or illicit drug use\n- pain clinics do compliance testing to see if they are compliant with pain medication to renew prescription adn they are taking they are taking it and not supplmenting it with anything\n- sexual assault cases \n- ICU if they came in from motor vehicle c\n",
        "SLIDE #: 5 || Analytical Approaches\n Tests for specific drugs/poisons (e.g. drugs of abuse) when clinical  information points directly to them\nGeneral analyses for any or all drugs/ poisons when information on the case is limited\nfirst is direct testing - test  for specific drug\nsecond to see classes of drugs they've been on or broad panel like mass spec to look at 100s \n",
        "SLIDE #: 6 || Interpretation of Analyses Serum/Plasma:\nSpecimen of choice to measure drug levels\nCan measure level of intoxication\nContains parent drugs and some metabolites\nAnalysis rather involved because of complex matrix including large amounts of lipid and protein present\nDrugs can be present in low concentration\nmain sample type is serum/plasma if you want to measure drug levels in patient\n- can tell you about intoxication or impact of having drug in system\n- more complex matrix and harder to test for because of lots of serum proteins and lipids in the sample\n- requires more sensitive technology like liquid chromatography or mass spec because drugs are often present in low concentrations\n",
        "SLIDE #: 7 || Interpretation of Analyses - Urine\nIndicates exposure (what drugs taken) but exact timeline of when the compound was ingested\nCannot measure level of intoxication\nContains mostly drug metabolites (sometimes parent drug)\nLess complex matrix results in simpler analysis due to very small amounts of lipid and protein present\nthe more common sample type is urine - this is because the question is usually 'what did the person take' rather than how much they took\n- doesn't tell you much about amount taken or when they took it (doesn't tell you a lot about intoxication)\n- most cases you only detect drug metabolites\n- it's a simpler matrix - less protein and fat - therefore easier to measure drug of interest\n",
        "SLIDE #: 8 || Interpretation of Analyses – \u000bGastric Fluid\nrelatively infrequently requested\n invasive specimen\nno advantage over serum or urine\nanother fluid type that could be tested is gastric fluid \n- this is very rarely tested because so invasive to retreive and not a lot of advantage \n- e.g. known ingestion or found inconscious with empty pill bottle and it is thought they consumed 100s of pills\n",
        "SLIDE #: 9 || Interpretation of Analyses  - Hair and Meconium\nThese testing matrices are used to determine long term exposure to drugs\nHair testing can be used to identify a timeline for drug abuse or compliance. (e.g. was this a one-time exposure or has there been chronic exposure)\nMeconium tests are requested in neonates when there is concern regarding long term exposure to drugs in utero.\nNot clinically useful for acute management – TAT is too long – weeks\nUsually only requested by CAS\nanother sample type is hair and meconium (first stool formed in baby ~ black stool that baby has)\n- both are good matrices for long term exposure to drugs\n- hair testing can be used as a timeline - closer to scalp = more recent drug use\n- meconium testing is done on neonates and often when it is during concern regarding exposure in utero (medications or drug of abuse mom consumed during pregnancy)\n- tests are only done by specialized labs\n",
        "SLIDE #: 10 || Types of Drugs /Poisons\n1. Alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol and acetone, ethylene glycol)\n2. Drugs of Abuse (cannabinoids, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine [PCP])\n3. Over-the-counter Drugs (salicylate, acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine)\n4. Prescription Drugs (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)\n5. Sexual assault drugs (gammahydroxybutyrate, flunitrazepam, ketamine)\n6. Heavy Metals (Pb, As, Hg)\n2. can be street drugs or pharmaceutical drugs\n",
        "SLIDE #: 11 || Ethanol\none of the most requested tox tests\nautomated, fast, convenient\nbased on alcohol dehydrogenase\nspecific for ethanol only\nif someone presents to ER with all signs of intoxication but they don't have ethanol\n",
        "SLIDE #: 12 || Toxic Volatile Alcohols\nMethanol    (windshield washer fluid, gas line antifreeze)\nIsopropanol    (rubbing alcohol)\nAcetone   (metabolite of isopropanol)\nthen you look at toxic volatile alcohols to see if they consumed these instead of ethanol \n",
        "SLIDE #: 13 || Glycols\nEthylene glycol         (antifreeze)\nPropylene Glycol     (numerous uses)\npeople might try to consume glycols in terms of suicidial intention/alcohol seeking behaviour \n",
        "SLIDE #: 14 || Toxic Alcohols\nmethanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol can only be analysed by gas chromatgraphy (GC)\nGC is also used to monitor treatment \n(ethanol therapy, fomepizole, and/or haemodialysis –methanol, EG\nsupportive treatment –  isopropanol/acetone)\nGC can be used to monitor treatment (make sure methabol/ethanol is decreasing)\ntreatment could be ethanol therapy to protect them from isoporonaol etc.\n- prevent ethanol from breaking  down into toxic metabolite\nfomepizole to prevent enzyme from breaking down and forming toxic metabolite\n^ most cases its followed up by hemodialysis to get rid of parent alchol and toxic emtabolite \nif overdose found than supportive treatment \n",
        "SLIDE #: 15 || example of GC chromatogram \ntop tracing is standards for volatiles - they are all chromatographically seperated from each other and each peak is diff retention time on column\nvolatile screen - patient sample only has peak correspodning with methanol and internal standard which helps quantify how mcuh tyey consumed\nethanol theraphy - large peak of ethanol because given to prevent methanol from forming toxic metabolite, peak of methanol is smaller\npost tretment - individual does not have ethanol or methanol detected\n",

        "SLIDE #: 18 || Unexplained   OGAP\nAn unexplained OGAP >10 mmol/L strongly suggests presence of something in addition to ethanol\nAn unexplained OGAP ≤10 mmol/L   - not helpful\n",
        "SLIDE #: 19 || Serum Osmolality Gap (OGAP)\nEthylene glycol is toxic at only 3.2 mmol/L \nMethanol is toxic at 8 mmol/L\nIf unexplained OGAP <=6 mmol/L, we encourage clinical staff to cancel the methanol/isopropanol screen but not a glycol screen\n",

        "SLIDE #: 24 || Sexual Assault Drugs\nSexual assault drugs can include any drug which will reduce inhibitions and/or awareness such as:\nalcohol, cannabis, Ecstasy (MDMA), or benzodiazepines\nThe classical application of the term “date rape drug” is to drugs which also induce amnesia of the assault (e.g. Gammahydroxybutyrate [GHB, GBL], flunitrazepam [Rohypnol], ketamine [Special K])\ntake serum or urine samples from victim and look to see if they were drugged\ndrugs are used to reduce inhibitions/awareness/memory\n",

The patient was found to have a critical Lithium level 2.5 mmol/L (RI 0.4 – 1.3) with mild acute on chronic kidney disease Cre 214.\nHe was on a stable lithium dose over the last few years and denies any intentional overdose and was taking his lithium as prescribed. Lithium was held until the lithium levels came down to below the reference range 0.4 mmol/L (6 days).\nRecommendation from Nephrology, Clinical Pharmacology, and Poison Centre was to hold the Lithium and give IV fluids, acute dialysis is not indicated to facilitate lithium clearance. \nMonitor kidney function with frequent volume assessments and watch for lithium induced diabetes insipidus .\nThe differential for his presentation would include lithium toxicity versus worsening of his underlying neurological disorder, secondary to decreased oral intake, GI symptoms, and hypovolumeia.\nPatient was referred to Psychiatry for reassessment of Bipolar disorder and lithium dosing\n",
