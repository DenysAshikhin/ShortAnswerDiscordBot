Toxicology
Purpose of Toxicology Testing:
To detect, identify, and possibly measure, in various biological fluids, drugs and poisons which may or may not be suspected to be present.
3
Substance could be illicit or prescribed 
3

Patients
Emergency
Babies and new mothers
Psychiatric
Pain Clinic
Sexual Assault Centre
Inpatients (ICU)


4
who do we look at for testing?
- most come from emergency departments where patients come in and you look for drug abuse
- new mothers and babies sometiems tested for illicit drug use for CAS cases
- psychiatric for compliance or illicit drug use
- pain clinics do compliance testing to see if they are compliant with pain medication to renew prescription adn they are taking they are taking it and not supplmenting it with anything
- sexual assault cases 
- ICU if they came in from motor vehicle c

Analytical Approaches

 Tests for specific drugs/poisons (e.g. drugs of abuse) when clinical  information points directly to them

General analyses for any or all drugs/ poisons when information on the case is limited
5
first is direct testing - test  for specific drug

second to see classes of drugs they've been on or broad panel like mass spec to look at 100s 
5

Interpretation of Analyses Serum/Plasma:
Specimen of choice to measure drug levels
Can measure level of intoxication
Contains parent drugs and some metabolites
Analysis rather involved because of complex matrix including large amounts of lipid and protein present
Drugs can be present in low concentration
6
main sample type is serum/plasma if you want to measure drug levels in patient
- can tell you about intoxication or impact of having drug in system
- more complex matrix and harder to test for because of lots of serum proteins and lipids in the sample
- requires more sensitive technology like liquid chromatography or mass spec because drugs are often present in low concentrations

6

Interpretation of Analyses - Urine
Indicates exposure (what drugs taken) but exact timeline of when the compound was ingested
Cannot measure level of intoxication
Contains mostly drug metabolites (sometimes parent drug)
Less complex matrix results in simpler analysis due to very small amounts of lipid and protein present
7
the more common sample type is urine - this is because the question is usually 'what did the person take' rather than how much they took
- doesn't tell you much about amount taken or when they took it (doesn't tell you a lot about intoxication)
- most cases you only detect drug metabolites
- it's a simpler matrix - less protein and fat - therefore easier to measure drug of interest
7

Interpretation of Analyses – Gastric Fluid

relatively infrequently requested

 invasive specimen

no advantage over serum or urine
8
another fluid type that could be tested is gastric fluid 
- this is very rarely tested because so invasive to retreive and not a lot of advantage 
- e.g. known ingestion or found inconscious with empty pill bottle and it is thought they consumed 100s of pills

8

Interpretation of Analyses  - Hair and Meconium
These testing matrices are used to determine long term exposure to drugs
Hair testing can be used to identify a timeline for drug abuse or compliance. (e.g. was this a one-time exposure or has there been chronic exposure)
Meconium tests are requested in neonates when there is concern regarding long term exposure to drugs in utero.
Not clinically useful for acute management – TAT is too long – weeks
Usually only requested by CAS

9
another sample type is hair and meconium (first stool formed in baby ~ black stool that baby has)
- both are good matrices for long term exposure to drugs
- hair testing can be used as a timeline - closer to scalp = more recent drug use
- meconium testing is done on neonates and often when it is during concern regarding exposure in utero (medications or drug of abuse mom consumed during pregnancy)
- tests are only done by specialized labs


9

Types of Drugs /Poisons
1. Alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol and acetone, ethylene glycol)
2. Drugs of Abuse (cannabinoids, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine [PCP])
3. Over-the-counter Drugs (salicylate, acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine)
4. Prescription Drugs (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)
5. Sexual assault drugs (gammahydroxybutyrate, flunitrazepam, ketamine)
6. Heavy Metals (Pb, As, Hg)
10
2. can be street drugs or pharmaceutical drugs

10

Ethanol

one of the most requested tox tests

automated, fast, convenient

based on alcohol dehydrogenase

specific for ethanol only



11
if someone presents to ER with all signs of intoxication but they don't have ethanol
11

Toxic Volatile Alcohols

Methanol    (windshield washer fluid, gas line antifreeze)

Isopropanol    (rubbing alcohol)

Acetone   (metabolite of isopropanol)
12
then you look at toxic volatile alcohols to see if they consumed these instead of ethanol 


12

Glycols

Ethylene glycol         (antifreeze)


Propylene Glycol     (numerous uses)
13
people might try to consume glycols in terms of suicidial intention/alcohol seeking behaviour 




13

Toxic Alcohols
methanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol can only be analysed by gas chromatgraphy (GC)

GC is also used to monitor treatment 
(ethanol therapy, fomepizole, and/or haemodialysis –methanol, EG
supportive treatment –  isopropanol/acetone)
14
GC can be used to monitor treatment (make sure methabol/ethanol is decreasing)

treatment could be ethanol therapy to protect them from isoporonaol etc.
- prevent ethanol from breaking  down into toxic metabolite

fomepizole to prevent enzyme from breaking down and forming toxic metabolite

^ most cases its followed up by hemodialysis to get rid of parent alchol and toxic emtabolite 

if overdose found than supportive treatment 
14

15
example of GC chromatogram 

top tracing is standards for volatiles - they are all chromatographically seperated from each other and each peak is diff retention time on column

volatile screen - patient sample only has peak correspodning with methanol and internal standard which helps quantify how mcuh tyey consumed

ethanol theraphy - large peak of ethanol because given to prevent methanol from forming toxic metabolite, peak of methanol is smaller

post tretment - individual does not have ethanol or methanol detected


15

Serum Osmolality Gap (OGAP)

OGAP  = Osmolality measured - Osmolality calculated
 
		   = Osmolality meas -  (2[Na] + [Glucose] + [Urea]) 
  
	          =    -10    to  +10

unexplained (residual)  OGAP   =   OGAP – [Ethanol]
16
OGAP is where you look for measured and calculated osmolality

submit sample of serum to laboratory which is measured for it and you also measure it for the main thing that takes it up in normal person (sodium, glucose, and urea) 

use both to calculate OGAP

measured is normally higher than calculated

measured componetnts are 2 times sodium (because sodium and chloride are there, glucose and urea)

 OGAP that is between -10 and +10 is normal OGAP

take the unexplained/residual OGAP - 

16

Unexplained   OGAP

Precision   (i.e. SD)   is  ± 6

Accumulation of measurement error of
Osmolality
Na
Glucose
Urea
Ethanol
17
precision of the OGAP - S.D could be +/- 6 due to accumulation error
- small errors in all measurments add up 
17

Unexplained   OGAP
An unexplained OGAP >10 mmol/L strongly suggests presence of something in addition to ethanol

An unexplained OGAP ≤10 mmol/L   - not helpful



18
18

Serum Osmolality Gap (OGAP)
Ethylene glycol is toxic at only 3.2 mmol/L 

Methanol is toxic at 8 mmol/L

If unexplained OGAP <=6 mmol/L, we encourage clinical staff to cancel the methanol/isopropanol screen but not a glycol screen
19

Acetaminophen
Tylenol
Other preparations (e.g. Percocet, Robaxacet, combination cold remedies)
Liver Toxicity is major concern
> 4 grams per day
Antidote

20
antidote - anacytalsitine or NAC - used to protect liver from toxic metabolite produced 


20

 The effect of a single oral dose of a drug  on its concentration in serum/ plasma
21
when you take a drug, you have absorption phase which peaks then a two phase distribtuion (distribution phase where it goes into tissues/fat and second one is elimination where it goes into bile or urine)

knwoing when you are taking medicaiton from ingestion is important for interpretation of it 
21

22
nomogram used in acetominophen overdosing

it starts at 4 hrs after ingestion to 16 hrs
- window where you are concerned about toxicitiy
- measure the levels and plot it relating to time and when you think ingestion occured
- more severe poisoning = more likely they are giving antidote
earlier testing is done, earlier antidotte given 
22

Salicylate
Aspirin
Other preparations (e.g. Percodan)
Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate)
Enteric-coated preparations
Leads to Metabolic Acidosis
Treatment is to enhance elimination
Ion traping
23
eteric coated is different formulation where it has different coating or release pattern for aspirin

ion trapping - salicylate is ionized and released primarily in urine so you enhance elimnation by taking acidic urine and make it charged to add more base to urine to keep the salicylate negatively charged and keeps them in the urine allowing you to pee them out 
- uncharged salicylate have abiity to be reabsorbed back into body 
23

Sexual Assault Drugs
Sexual assault drugs can include any drug which will reduce inhibitions and/or awareness such as:
alcohol, cannabis, Ecstasy (MDMA), or benzodiazepines
The classical application of the term “date rape drug” is to drugs which also induce amnesia of the assault (e.g. Gammahydroxybutyrate [GHB, GBL], flunitrazepam [Rohypnol], ketamine [Special K])

24
take serum or urine samples from victim and look to see if they were drugged

drugs are used to reduce inhibitions/awareness/memory


24

Urine Drug  Testing
25
25

How Long are Drugs Detectable in Urine?*
*Dose and individual dependent
Drug
Estimated Window of Detection
Drug Screen Threshold (Cutoff) Concentration ng/mL (μmol/L)
 
Amphetamines
1 - 3 days
1000 (7.41)
Barbiturates
short/intermediate acting
phenobarbital
 
2 - 4 days
Several weeks
200 (0.84)
Benzodiazepines
1 - 7 days
200 (0.70)
Cannabinoids
4 - 30 days
50 (0.147)
Cocaine
 
300 (1.04)
Opiates (Morphine or Codeine)
2-3 days
300 (1.05)
GHB
1 day (max)
10 ug/mL
26
this is the first question in urine drug testing

urine is primary choice because it is helpful in determining exposure of drug (not intoxication/effect of drug)

half life gives you window of detection to find out if they consumed drugs

shorter half life = shorter window of detection

earlier you get the urine sample, more likely you will be able to pick up the trace of these

drug screening have different cutt offs for different methadologies

26

Terminology

Screening Test:

initial test which distinguishes a negative result from a presumptive positive
27
27

Terminology

Presumptive Positive:

positive screen test result not yet validated by a confirmation  test

28
in most cases, confirmation test/methodoly is by some type of mass spec method where you have definitive peak/fragmentation pattern compared to standard and you know it was present 

most often come from immunoassay or POC
28

Terminology

Confirmation Test:

definitive test which conclusively establishes the
presumptive positive screen result as a true or false
positive


29
confirm. testing normally done with mass spec method 
29

Terminology

True Positive: 

   a positive screening test result which has been validated by a positive confirmation test result
30
both screening methodology and confirmation test both say drug is there in sample
30

Terminology

False Positive:

    a presumptive positive screening test result which has been invalidated by a negative confirmation test result

31
normally due to cross reactivity to some other drug in sample
31

Toxicology Methods

1.  Screening Methods

2.  Confirmation Methods
32
screening methods - rapid, easy to use, present in POC testing by lateral flow strips or core lab

confirmation methods - based on mass spec 
32

Common Screen Methods Specific screen methods:
Core Lab or POCT (mostly immunoassays)
Qual or Quant
Fast & Cheap (relatively)
Sensitive screening methods
False Positives?
Serum(acetaminophen, salicylate, ethanol)
Urine
Drugs of abuse screens (urine)
Prescription drug screens (mostly urine)
cannabinoids
opiates (but NOT oxycodone; poor cross-reactivity)
amphetamines
barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital)
cocaine
benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam)
opiates
serum tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline)
33
they can be qualitative (so either present or absent)

quantitative e.g. in core lab where you can know if they are close to threshold, twice the threshold, half of it etc. 

these are fast, quick, short TAT (within an hour or minute)

sensitive - can pick up many drugs

not every drug in a class is equally good at causing a positive (doesn't react quite as well with antibodies)

prone to false positivies because of interferent or other drug in sample which causing a false positive but it is not the class of drug that you want 

it is important to know class (?)
- 
33

Significant Cross-reactivity Problems

Amphetamines
			(pseudoephedrine,  e.g. Sudafed).

Tricyclic antidepressant drugs 
			(30% false positives)

Cannabinoids
	              (50% of all neonatal positives can be false)
34
cross reactivity causes false positives

amphetamines cross react with psudeoephedrine 

tricyclic antidepressant
- structure is common to a lot of drugs

cannabinoids 

34

Tricyclic Immunoassay Screen Cross-reactants
Diphenhydramine
Phenothiazines
Carbamazepine
Cyclobenzaprine
Hydroxyzine
Orphenadrine
Cyproheptadine
35
not all of these are highly prescribed or used

carbamazepine - antiepileptic drug


35

Causes Of False Positive Immunoassay Drug Screen Results
[Drug] is close to but below the cutoff conc’n

Presence of interfering substances 
(usually other drugs)
36
due to interfering substance (some other drug)

or drug gets close to cut-off
- be a little bit higher than cut off but in confirmation testing its not high enough to reach cut off
- could be due to the fact that parent drug/other drugs in the same class collectively bind and react in immunoassay therefore collectively theyre all greater in cutt off but when looking at them individually they might not meet it 
36

Confirmation Methods

greater analytical sensitivity than the screen

based on a different chemical principle

HPLC,  GC,  triple quad LCMS,   GC/MS
37
measure lower concentrations and definiatively tell compound's presence

method is based on mass spec usually which is a different pricniple than immunoassay

could be done by HPLC or GC but more commonly done by LCMS or GC/MS


37

Screen Confirmation
Positive screen result for drugs of abuse and prescription drugs
Indeterminate screen result may be close but below the cut-off level,
False positive screen result due to cross reactivity or interference from other drugs is always possible
It is not necessary to do confirmations on all samples containing drugs, for example:
Nicotine (unless insurance testing)
Caffeine
Therapeutic drugs for which there are assays available
Prescribed drugs (known to be taken by patient).

38
38

Criteria for Confirmation Testing:
Presumptive positive immunoassay screen result
Any uncertainty in the identification of a drug in the initial drug screen (e.g. GC/MS or LC/MS/MS)
Request from patient care giver
39
if you need to know the true positive then you need to do a confirmation test


39

Criteria for Confirmation Testing:
Reality check:

In the clinical setting, confirmation testing cannot be done in real time for Emerg. Dept. needs


And so many drug screens are ordered by ED.
   Tox lab confirmation tests cannot keep up anyway

Confirmation testing done on request only.

Absolutely necessary in forensic toxicology testing to determine cause of death with certainty

40
when determining if to do a confirmation test, do a reality check, figure out if you need it and if it clinically impacts the case

usually by ED, they want to determine what drug the overdose was and that's all they need to know to treat
- ED though might be acting before the screening result
ED also orders them for patients admitted to psychiatry - to figure out what the patient came into the ED On 

confirmation testing requires more investment of time and greater TAT therefore no clinical use to ED 

confirmation testing done in certain clinical situations like pain clinics and forensic investigation 


40

Toxidromes
41
clinically, they are assessing toxidromes (clinical parameters they can measure to assess what potential drug a patient overdosed on)
- they do this along with screening methodology sent to core lab 

toxidromes - clinically assess respiratory rate, HR, blood pressure, size of pupils, temperature, bowel, sweat and energy

you can clinically classify drug overdose into one of these five categories which can dictate what the treatment should be

all they need from the lab is a screen result to confirm that clinical picture and results match that they are on the right track

anticholinergic - basically fight or flight response by someone

noloxone is therapy for opioid overdose



41

Part 2 - Toxicology Cases
42

Case 1:
A patient with is history of elicit drug use was seen in clinic and is asked to submit a specimen to undergo a urine drug screen to assess for Rx compliance. Their Rx include: Oxycodone, Morphine, Diazepam, Adderall (amphetamine)

Testing done in Core laboratory by Homogenous IA (KIMS methodology)
44
send screening testing to core laboratory - done with homogenous immunoassay

physicians have to determine if that makes sense with the prescriped drugs

the screen can't tell you if it is prescription or elicit

opiates positive is consistent with prescription of morphine, so is oxycodene

physicians may want to request confirmation testing for the amphatmines or benzos


44

45
example of the GC/MS results for this patient

patient has a positive/peak for cocaine -- so screening for cocaine got confirmed

small peak for diazepam; maybe dose missed or its a low level accounted for by the negative screen but still detected by the more sensitive methodology
45

MDMA
MDA
46
amphetamines - you can tell them apart by fragmentation pattern


46

Methamphetamine
Amphetamine
47
fragmentation pattern slightly different for these

same class of drugs but different fragmentation - screen result would be positive
this will tell you which one was taken

aceptominophne (APAP) and serum - not detected 

then someone measured lithium levels - he was prescribed it for his bipolar - it was critically high


58

Lithium Toxicity
Acute – lithium naïve patients who overdose
Chronic – on maintenance Li therapy with some change – increase dose, reduced kidney function, or new drug-drug interaction
Acute on chronic – existing burden (from chronic maintenance therapy) and are acutely exposed to a large burden

Case 3 - Conclusion
After doing a comprehensive laboratory investigation including UDS, toxic alcohol screen and lithium level for TDM. The patient was found to have a critical Lithium level 2.5 mmol/L (RI 0.4 – 1.3) with mild acute on chronic kidney disease Cre 214.
He was on a stable lithium dose over the last few years and denies any intentional overdose and was taking his lithium as prescribed. Lithium was held until the lithium levels came down to below the reference range 0.4 mmol/L (6 days).
Recommendation from Nephrology, Clinical Pharmacology, and Poison Centre was to hold the Lithium and give IV fluids, acute dialysis is not indicated to facilitate lithium clearance. 
Monitor kidney function with frequent volume assessments and watch for lithium induced diabetes insipidus .
The differential for his presentation would include lithium toxicity versus worsening of his underlying neurological disorder, secondary to decreased oral intake, GI symptoms, and hypovolumeia.
Patient was referred to Psychiatry for reassessment of Bipolar disorder and lithium dosing

Lithium Toxicity
Lithium toxicity treatment guidelines for Dialysis: 
Lithium level >6 mmol/L: any patient
Lithium level >4 mmol/L: any patient on chronic lithium therapy
Lithium level between 2.5 and 4 mmol/L: any patient with severe neurologic symptoms, renal insufficiency, or unstable hemodynamically or neurologically
Lithium level <2.5 mmol/L: hemodialysis indicated only for patients with end-stage renal disease or patients whose lithium levels increase after admission or who fail to reach a lithium level below 1 mmol/L in 30 h

Lithium Toxicity
Current clinical practice in the fields of Psychiatry and Geriatric Psychiatry, expert opinion, and the literature, the the upper limit (1.3 mmol/L) was deemed too high for the elderly. 
Recommended therapeutic interval of 0.4-0.8 mmol/L in patients ≥ 65  years of age.

Conclusions
These cases are to illustrate the need for toxicology testing in the compliance and over dose setting
Important to recognize the differences between screening and confirmation testing
