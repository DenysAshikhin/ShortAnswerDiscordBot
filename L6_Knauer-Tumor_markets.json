        "SLIDE #: 3 || What is cancer?\nIt is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and division of cells (proliferation) that can develop into a solid mass (tumor) and spread to other areas of the body. \nCancer develops as a consequence of multiple genetic mutations which usually occur over a long period of time. These mutations are often in genes that disrupt cell cycle, differentiation or apoptosis (programmed cell death) pathways \nActivated oncogene\nUncontrolled Growth \n",

        "SLIDE #: 16 || Role of Laboratory Tests: Screening\nScreening \nScreening refers to looking for cancer in people who have no symptoms of the disease. \nEarly detection is finding cancer at an early stage, when it’s less likely to have spread and is easier to treat.\nbut very few markers have been shown to be helpful in screening\neither markers arent snesitivie enough \n",

        "SLIDE #: 21 || Role of Laboratory Tests: Diagnosis\nDiagnosis\nTumor makers doesn’t help in establishing the diagnosis per se in most of the cases but corroborates it\nHelps in distinguish benign from malignant cases in some tumors\nIn patients that have symptoms, tumor markers may be used to help identify the source of the cancer, such as CA-125 for ovarian cancer, and to help differentiate it from other conditions\n",

        "SLIDE #: 23 || Role of Laboratory Tests: Prognosis\nStaging and Prognosis\nIf a patient has cancer, tumor marker elevations can be used to help determine how far the cancer has spread (staging) into other tissues and organs and how aggressive a cancer is likely to be (prognosis)\nThe presence or absence of a tumor marker or its quantification helps in determining the prognosis\nTumor marker concentration generally increases with tumor progression, reaching their highest levels when tumors metastasize.\nelevations in marker can tell you how far cancer spread and stage it \ncan also tell you how aggressive it is\n",

Suspected cancer of the head of the pancreas was based on given the history, physical examination, and clinical presentation, tumor markers were also ordered. \n\tLab result:\nLipase \t800 U/L (13 – 60 U/L)\nAmylase\t104 U/L (30 – 100 U/L)\nALP \t213 U/L (35 – 100 U/L)\nLD\t293 U/L (100 – 250 U/L)\nBilirubin\t115 umol/L (3.5 – 20 umol/L)\n\tOrder: \nCA19.9 \t241 U/mL (≤ 33 U/mL)\nRole of Laboratory Tests: Prognosis\nIf they were elevated above the reference range, it would most likely indicate cancer of the head of the pancreas in stage 2 or later. \nChemotherapy and radiation therapy would most likely be initiated.\nlipase elevated\nALP elevated\nLD - above reference interval\nbilirubin - elevated\nCA19.9 is also elevated\njust because tests are above, you can guess type/stage of cancer -- likely guess it is stage 2 cancer\n",
        "SLIDE #: 25 || Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose until it is advanced and, thus chemotherapy and radiation therapy haven’t been very successful in curing or treating the disease\nBecause pancreatic cancer often presents with nonspecific symptoms until it reaches advanced stages, there is a need for good staging indicators\nSome indicators that have been used include serum enzymes such as amylase and lipase, ectopically produced hormones, and tumor-associated antigens: CA19.9  that provide the best specificity and sensitivity\nRole of Laboratory Tests: Prognosis\n",

        "SLIDE #: 27 || Role of Laboratory Tests: Monitoring\nMonitoring effectiveness of therapy and disease recurrence\nSeeing if certain treatments are likely to work or how well treatment is working.\nOne of the biggest uses for tumor markers is to monitor for cancer recurrence. \nIf a tumor marker is elevated before treatment, low after treatment, and then begins to rise over time, it is likely that the cancer is returning. (If it remains elevated after surgery, then chances are that not all of the cancer was removed). \nThe changes are important, which is why results of a series of level tests often mean more than a single result. If at all possible it’s best to compare results from tests done at the same lab, and always be sure that the results are of the same value.\nmore common ways is to measure it after person has been clear or in remission - this could be sign that cancer is back if it is elevated \nelevated before treatment, low after = means that treatment is working\nimportant to do serial monitoring to look for changes in levels of it \n- same lab because immunoassays are not standardized between vendors/kits therefore differences between labs can affect levels\n",

        "SLIDE #: 30 || Recommendations\nWhen ordering tumor markers\nNever rely on result of a single test\nMultiple markers should be considered to improve the outcome of the test (improve sensitivity and specificity)\nRepeat tests while following up should be ordered from the same lab using same kit\nDo serial testing\nWhile monitoring recurrence, make sure the tumor marker level was elevated before surgery (check baseline)\nThe half-life of the marker (know the metabolism of tumor markers) should be taken into account before interpreting the result\nuse same lab/vendor when repeating tests\nserial testing - before treatment, after treatment, and after remission\nset baseline level and compare successive measurements back to it \n",

Men at high risk for prostate cancer should talk to their primary care provider before age 40 about prostate cancer.\u000b\u000b3. At or over age 70, the decision to end prostate cancer screening should be based on an informed discussion with their primary care provider.\u000b \nWhile the PSA test is not currently used in Canada as a population-wide screening tool, it is used to monitor how someone responds to cancer treatment or to monitor disease recurrence or progression.\n\u000b\n",

        "SLIDE #: 48 || PSA: Case study\nQuestions:\nIf this patient has cancer limited to the prostate, should PSA levels be monitored  after radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy?\nYes. PSA is extremely useful for monitoring cancer recurrence in patients following therapeutic intervention for prostate cancer.\nPSA (ug/L)\nAfter therapy, PSA levels should be extremely low or undetectable, with rising levels indicating recurrent disease. There is a direct relationship between the serum PSA concentration and the volume of prostate gland.\n"
