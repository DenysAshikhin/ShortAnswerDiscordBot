1) The data collected: 
Short Answer Bot collects the background data about how you use discord (number of messages sent, date of last message, 
time spent in a voice channel, time spent in an AFK channel) and data that you provide with consent.
This includes the personall games list, music playlist, whether you want to be pinged/DM'ed for game summons. 
Moreover any setting related information such as prefixes, and completed tutorials.

2) Why is this data required:
The data is required and used strictly to enable greater and more complex features on the bot. Some of the more
unique features would be down right impossible without knowing: your games list, music playlists, twitch follows
(again all of this information is only known if you choose to give it to the bot).

3) How do I use this data:
The data is used only when the relevant commands are requested by the users of the bot. I.E.: If someone is trying to 
find a people to play a game, then the bot check whether the requested game is in your games list.

4) Other than discord and users of the bot, who else sees this data. No one. I store this on a mongoDB database,
however it is encrypted. As such, beyond discord and the bot users, no third party has access to this information.

5) 
The most reliable way to contact me is on discord (The Last Spark#7586), however, I can also be reached by email at
denysashikhin@gmail.com.

6) How can you remove the stored information:
With all commands that ask for information there is an associated command to remove that information. However, if you 
want to ensure all, or some specific personal data is destroyed, contact me as mentioned in point 5) and I will 
be more than happy to do so.
