        "SLIDE #: 3 || Therapeutic Drug Monitoring\nObjectives:\nTDM in the context of pharmacological principles\nThe parameters involved in TDM\nThe role of appropriate sampling in TDM\nSpecial case examples – particular applications in  TDM.\n",
        "SLIDE #: 4 || Therapeutic Drug Monitoring\nWhat is it and Why is it Done?\nTherapeutic Drug Monitoring\n(TDM) refers to the  measurement of drug  concentrations in the blood  or plasma of a patient to  keep it within a target range.\nTDM provides information  about the adequacy of  dosing of the drug regimen  and the likelihood of toxicity  associated with the drug.\nTDM\nDosing\nToxicity\nMonitoring\nThings that affect tdm is dosing, compliance/monitoring (person is taking it or not), toxicity (taking too much)\n",
        "SLIDE #: 5 || Which Drugs need TDM?\nNarrow Therapeutic Range\nSignificant pharmacokinetic variability\nA reasonable relationship between plasma  concentrations and clinical effects; however the  pharmacological effect is hard to measure\nMedications prone to drug interactions\nCompliance issues or drugs prone to therapeutic  failure\n",
        "SLIDE #: 6 || Why do Therapeutic Drug Monitoring  (TDM)?\nNarrow Therapeutic Range\nDrugs have therapeutic ranges\nTaking a drug orally is in this diagram \nAs you take it, concentration goes up peaks, and as eliminated it goes down\nReaches blue in is the minimum therapeutic effect\nOnce it goes below level of effect there is no pain relief \nToxic concentration is exceeding right\nMore dangerous drugs have smaller therapeutic ranges – harder to keep drug level effective yet not toxic\nMost durgs tho, you don’t take once, you take repeatably\nThe challenge is to keep the peak and trough in the therapeutic range in each successive dosing\nDpeening on range, it could be hrader or easier to keep the drug in the safe zone\n",
        "SLIDE #: 7 || Therapeutic Range with  Repeated Dosing\nBlue line is continuous infusion (IV) / red Is oral\nHow constant influion would get you up in the range and keeps you in the correct range so you don’t have overdosing and eventually get to steady state concentration\nAs long as noghting perturbes steady state that dose will keep you in the therapeutic range\n",
        "SLIDE #: 8 || Why do Therapeutic Drug  Monitoring (TDM)?\nVariable  Pharmacokinetics\nWhat the body does to the drug\nAbsorption\nDistribution\nMetabolism\nElimination\nWhen you first take it you have to absorb it from GI tract\nDistrinbute it around body through venous system and get to site of action\nMetabolism – via liver and kidney to eliminate to more polar molecules or deactivate the drug to inactive metabolite (also some cases wehre you take inactive drug and activate in body)\nEliminate is getting rid of it \n",
        "SLIDE #: 9 || Why do Therapeutic Drug  Monitoring (TDM)?\nVariable  Pharmacokinetics\nNot One Dose Fits All\nLevy\nBioDrugs, 2001\nInter-patient Variability in Cylosporine  Blood Levels in Renal Transplant Patients\nDiff people have diff pharmacokinetics\nLines don’t overlap – peak happens at diff points for diff people\nPeak height (amount of absorption) different between people\nThere is significant variability in terms of giving same drugs nad what happens after taking it \n",
        "SLIDE #: 10 || Pharmacokinetics – Fate of a Drug taken  Orally\nFirst Pass  Effect\nThere are rate equations to monitor drugs when they come into body\nTake it, absorbed in small intestine, portal vein to liver which converts from parent molecule to metabolite, which is then excreted or sent to bile to be eliminated\nWhen you take a drug not all the drug gets into circulation; percentage gets eliminated before and bioavailability (amount of drug that makes it into systemic circulation – e.g. 70% bioavailability means 70% makes it to ciruclaiont  after liver– you can bypass this by IV which has 100% bioavailability)\nDrug parent and drug metabolite are in equilibrium with compartments – e.g. compartment could be fat store, muscle, or single organ\nEffect compartment is when drug ofi nterest and organ of interest (eg. Knee for knee pain); drug and metabolite would all distribute\nThey can equilibrate back to centre compartment and this is where you can eliminate the drug (through kidney or liver by urine or feces)\n",
        "SLIDE #: 11 || The effect of a single oral dose of a drug  on its concentration in serum/ plasma\nExample of a two compartment model\nSlow eliminatation \nModelled by two rate curces\nDrug distributing into tissues in the body (faster rate)\nSlower elimination rate – drug eliminated through urine or feces\n",
        "SLIDE #: 12 || T1/2 (Elimination) Half  Life\nTime required for the concentration  of a drug to be reduced by half  (50%).\nNot all drugs are thes same for half life\n",
        "SLIDE #: 13 || Half Lives - Examples\nAcetaminophen –\n2 h\nCodeine –\n3 h\nTheophylline –\n8 h\nCarbamazepine –\n15 h\nLithium –\n22 h\nDigoxin –\n39 h\n(1.6 d)\nSirolimus –\n69 h\n(2.9 d)\nPhenobarbital –\n99 h\n(4.1 d)\nDigoxin drug for heart\nSirolimus immunosuppresent\nPhenobarbital antieppilypetic\nNot everyone has same half life\n",
        "SLIDE #: 14 || The effect of multiple identical  doses on drug concentration\nCmax & Cmin = maximum & minimum  concentrations\nC = average steady state concentration  MTC = minimum toxic concentration  MEC = minimum effective  concentration\nAUC = Area Under the Curve (a  measure of the exposure of the  patient to the drug)\nτ = dosing interval\nMinimul effective concentration is blue zone\nMiddle is therapeutic range\nEach oral dosing gets you into therapeutic range and you hit your steady state\nTime between dosing is dosing interval - it is approximating half lfie of the drug (take it once a day if half life is 24 hours e.g.)\nAUC is area under curve – can tell you how well the drug is absorbed and how much exposure individual gets\nC trough – what happens right before next oral dose\nMean is steady state concentration\nHow long does it take to get to steady state? 5 half lives to get to stady state or 5 half lives to eliminate the drugs\n",
        "SLIDE #: 15 || Effect of frequency of dosing\nFrequency and dosing amount to keep it in range? In this example you see:\nInfusion of drug at 28 mg/h – reaches steady state and is pretty consistent \nSame drug at 224 mg/h (three times in a day – tid) orally, you can see effects as it peaks and troughs as it gets to theraptutic range – doesn’t matter what dosing you took it takes same amount of time to get into the range (5 half lives)\nConveniemce is having to take the drug once a day\nVurve has wider swings in peaks and troughs at higher concetration \nFor a narrow range, you want to avoid more swings so you have to lower does and increase dosing interval to keep swings smaller and keep it in thereapuetic range\n",
        "SLIDE #: 16 || Loading doses\nIf you can’t wait 5 half lives to get to therapeutic level in a drug so this is where loading doses come in\nDrugs wit hlong half life and you need effect rapidly (e.g. anticlotting drug) you want to give massive dose right off the bat (loading dose) and then maintance dose (smaller dose) to keep htem in the range\n",
        "SLIDE #: 17 || Loading Dose -  Calculation\nC = 1.44 t1/2 D\nVdT\nWhere C is the average drug concentration in plasma  Vd is the apparent volume of distribution\nt1/2 is the elimination half-life\nD is the maintenance dose for this drug conc’n  T is dosage interval (time between doses)\nVd is where the theoretical space of where the drug goes in body – 5-6 L than the drug stays in blood volume, 1000 L then it stays in circulation and starts going into the tissue\nYou can look up Vd is for a drug\n",
        "SLIDE #: 18 || Loading Dose -  Calculation\nC = 1.44 t1/2 D\nVdT\nThe total amount (weight) of drug in the body\n=\tCVd\nTherefore, the loading dose\tD*\t= CVd\nD*\t= CVd\t= 1.44 t1/2 D\nT\n",
        "SLIDE #: 19 || Elimination Kinetics\nFirst Order  Kinetics and  the Rule of 5\no 50%\no 25%\no 12.5%\no 6.25%\no 3.1% (97%\neliminated)\nTwo ways drugs are eliminated – 0 order kinetics or 1st order kinetics\n0 order kinetics is same amount of drug eliminated over time; 2 mg eliminated of drug per minute\nIt is how alcohol is metabolized – you metabolzie same amount of alcohol in same amount of time \nFirst order kinetics is wehre you metabolize same proportion of drugs per unit time\n2% of drug metabolized per minute\nThis matters when it comes to dosing - if you had something with first order kinetics it means it drops out of pocket range quicker than 0 order kinetics (which takes longer for it to come down from toxic rnage)\nMost drugs behave in 1st order\nFirst half life – 50% of drug remaining\nSecond half life – 25% drug left\n5th – drug essentially eliminated\n",
        "SLIDE #: 20 || The Clinical Need\tfor  TDM\nCompliance\n(forgetfulness, etc.)\nTitration of optimal dosage\nVariation in drug metabolic rates (genetics, other drugs)\nPresence of disease (eg. renal, hepatic)\nAltered physiological states (youth, age, pregnancy)\nOverdose\nIdentification and quantitation\nChildren’s enzyme system don’t prform same way as adults\nPregnancy can cause internal changes to blood volume, binding proteiins in blood etc. \nTo try and identify if someone overdosed or how much of an overdose they have\n",
        "SLIDE #: 21 || Classical Criteria for Determining  the Necessity for TDM of a Drug\nNarrow but reasonably well defined  therapeutic range\nPoor correlation between dosage and serum  concentration\nGood correlation between serum  concentration and therapeutic effect\nTherapeutic effect which is hard to measure\nSpecific, accurate, and reproducible  method\n",
        "SLIDE #: 22 || When to sample?\nAt steady-state\nTrough\n-Just before the next dose is given (e.g. one half-life after\nthe last dose)\nWhen toxicity is suspected\nTimed sampling following a dose\nUsed to estimate AUC\nEg C2 for ISD\nRandom (last resort)\nOverdose (accidental or deliberate)\nPatient non-compliance (last dose unknown)\nTrough is best time to take it for oral dosing\nTime to catch peak and trough\nCurve estimation is exposure individual gets from the drug\nOnly do random during overdose and maybe used to determine drastic measures you may have to take or when you don’t know when they took the drug\n",
        "SLIDE #: 23 || Examples of Trough Measured Drugs (FYI):\nCore Lab:\nvalproic acid, carbamazepine,  lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital,  vancomycin\nSpecialty Lab:\tlamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate,  clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, risperidone,  haloperidol, olanzapine, nitrazepam, amiodarone\nMeasure drug in core and speciality labs\nDepends on method where the drug measruements go\nDrugs with servious consequences in core labs because of fast turnaround time e.g. epileptics, antibiotics\nSpeciality labs because you need selectivity to determine parent/metabolite or if drug you can’t do in core\n",
        "SLIDE #: 24 || Free Drug Monitoring\nFree drug monitoring\nIts not just drug and metabolite, but drug, free drug, drug bound to protein, and then metabolite that you have to consider\nProtein bound drug is normally albumin or positively charged drug, and alphaone/glycoprotein for negatively charged drug\nIn some cases, measuring free amount is better for concentraiotn/effect than total amount (which is free + protein bound)\n",
        "SLIDE #: 25 || Criteria for Free Drug Monitoring\nTDM is necessary\nDrug highly (> 70%) bound to plasma proteins  Free drug level correlates poorly with total drug\nconcentrations\nAlso when balance of bound to not can be disturbed negatively for e.g. if you take another drug or changing free fatty acids present (depends on the drug) or changing plasma protein concetraions (if someone is becoming malnourished)\n",
        "SLIDE #: 26 || Free Drug Monitoring\nCo-administered highly bound drugs\nElevated free fatty acids\nChanges in plasma protein concentration\n",
        "SLIDE #: 27 || Factors affecting Albumin  Concentration\nDecreased\nMalnutrition  Renal Disease  Malabsorption\nProtein-losing Enteropathy  Hepatic Disease\nBurns\nTissue Damage\nInflammation\nIncreased\nDehydration  Cancer\nRenal – less protein in blood therefore less binding capacity\nProtein-losing Enteropathy\nLosing protein through gut \nHepatic Disease\nNot produring proteins\nBurns  - disturbances in protein\n^^ all these things increase free drug and lower albumin (protein)\n",
        "SLIDE #: 28 || Free Drug Monitoring\nThe anticonvulsant drugs, phenytoin, and valproic  acid historically are the only drugs for which free  drug monitoring has been done routinely.\nFree drug is better for these than total drug \nThere are total drug assays available for these in the core lab quickly; specialized lab does free from bound drug \n",

        "SLIDE #: 50 || Epilepsy - Overview\nEpilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological  disorder) in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes  disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour,  sensations and sometimes loss of consciousness.\nSeizure symptoms can vary widely.\nFrom a simply blank stare for a few seconds to repeated twitching of arms or legs.\nAbout 1 in 26 people in the United States will develop a  seizure disorder.\nNearly 10% of individuals may have a single unprovoked seizure.\nHowever, a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked  seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.\nEven mild seizures may require treatment because they can  be dangerous during activities such as driving or swimming.\nTreatment with medications or surgery is ~80% effective\nChildren with epilepsy may also outgrow their condition with\nage.\n",

        "SLIDE #: 52 || Focal Seizures\nWhen seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in  just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial)  seizures.\nFocal seizures without loss of consciousness (simple\npartial seizures).\nThese seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or  change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in  involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous  sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.\nFocal dyscognitive seizures (complex partial seizures).\nThese seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During  a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally  to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing,  chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.\nSymptoms may be confused with other neurological  disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness.\n",
